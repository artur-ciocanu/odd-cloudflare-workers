# Background
This repository tries to demonstrate how we can leverage `Adobe Target NodeJS SDK` with On-Device Dcisioning from a `Cloudflare Worker`.

The repository contains two folders:
- `script` - here we have all the code and build scripts required by the `Cloudflare Worker`
- `terraform` - here we have all the Terraform code that is responsible to create the `zone`, `route` and `worker script`.
